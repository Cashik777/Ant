        "p_intro": "Baristas at cafés have spent years perfecting their technique. They work with expensive equipment and constantly adjust every parameter. But here's the good news: with the right knowledge, you can make espresso that rivals any café.",
        "h3_1": "❌ Mistake 1: Stale Coffee",
        "p_mistake1": "This is mistake #1. Espresso ruthlessly exposes every flaw in your beans. If your coffee is more than 3-4 weeks post-roast, it's already lost most of its aromatic compounds. Counterintuitively, too-fresh coffee (less than 5-7 days) is also problematic — it contains too much CO2 that interferes with extraction.",
        "solution1": "✅ <strong>Solution:</strong> Use coffee 7-21 days after roasting. Check the date on the bag. Buy less, but more frequently.",
        "h3_2": "❌ Mistake 2: Wrong Grind Size",
        "p_mistake2": "Too coarse — water passes through too quickly, under-extraction occurs. Result: watery, sour shot. Too fine — water barely seeps through, over-extraction occurs. Result: bitter, burnt taste. Ideal extraction time for a double shot: 25-30 seconds.",
        "solution2": "✅ <strong>Solution:</strong> Adjust grind step by step. Record extraction time. Target: 25-30 seconds for 36-40g output from 18-20g input.",
        "h3_3": "❌ Mistake 3: Uneven Tamping",
        "p_mistake3": "If you press the tamper at an angle, water finds the path of least resistance and creates 'channels' — spots where it flows faster. Part of the coffee over-extracts (bitter), part under-extracts (sour). Result: inconsistent, unbalanced shot.",
        "solution3": "✅ <strong>Solution:</strong> Keep your elbow at 90°, press evenly with ~15-20kg force. Surface should be perfectly level. Use a WDT tool before tamping.",
        "h3_4": "❌ Mistake 4: Wrong Water Temperature",
        "p_mistake4": "92-96°C is the ideal range. Too hot water (>96°C) burns coffee, producing bitterness and burnt flavors. Too cold (<90°C) under-extracts, creating sour, weak shots. Many home machines don't reach or maintain proper temperature.",
        "solution4": "✅ <strong>Solution:</strong> Warm up machine for at least 15-20 minutes. Run a blank shot before your first pull. Consider a PID controller for more precise control.",
        "h3_5": "❌ Mistake 5: Ignoring Dose and Scales",
        "p_mistake5": "Making espresso 'by eye' is a recipe for inconsistency. Today it's good, tomorrow it's not, and you don't know why. Standard recipe: 18g coffee in → 36g liquid out (1:2 ratio) in 25-30 seconds.",
        "solution5": "✅ <strong>Solution:</strong> Get a scale accurate to 0.1g (they're inexpensive). Weigh coffee in AND liquid out. Record parameters of successful shots.",
        "h3_6": "❌ Mistake 6: Dirty Equipment",
        "p_mistake6": "Coffee oils go rancid over time and accumulate in the portafilter, group head screen, and basket. This old residue adds bitterness and off-flavors to every shot. If your machine hasn't been cleaned recently — you're drinking a mix of fresh coffee and month-old buildup.",
        "solution6": "✅ <strong>Solution:</strong> Wipe portafilter after every shot. Backflush daily (if machine supports it). Deep clean with coffee detergent once a week.",
        "h3_7": "❌ Mistake 7: Bad Water",
        "p_mistake7": "Espresso is 90% water. Hard water with lots of minerals blocks subtle flavors and leaves scale in your boiler. Chlorinated water kills aromas. Too soft (distilled) doesn't extract enough.",
        "solution7": "✅ <strong>Solution:</strong> Use filtered water or bottled with low mineralization. TDS 50-150 ppm is ideal. Avoid unfiltered tap water.",

It's a place where coffee isn't just a beverage — it's part of the nation's soul.",

One day he noticed something strange: his goats, usually calm and slow, suddenly began dancing and jumping with incredible energy. Kaldi followed them and saw they were eating bright red berries from a small bush. Curious, the shepherd tried the berries himself — and felt an unusual surge of energy and mental clarity.",
        "p_1_2": "Kaldi shared his discovery with monks at a nearby monastery. At first they were skeptical, even throwing the berries into the fire as 'devil's fruit.'

Thus, the tradition of coffee was born.",

        "p_1": "Specialty Coffee is not a brand or a variety. It's an official term introduced by the Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) to designate coffee of the highest quality. To earn this status, coffee must score 80 points or higher on a 100-point scale during professional cupping. Less than 3% of the world's coffee achieves this level. Think about it: out of every 100 kilograms of harvested beans, only 3 kilograms can be called Specialty. The rest ends up on supermarket shelves labeled as 'premium' or '100% Arabica' — words that actually guarantee nothing about quality.",
        "h2_2": "How is Specialty Coffee Graded?",
        "p_2": "Professional tasters called Q-graders evaluate coffee using strict SCA protocols. They're the 'sommeliers of the coffee world' — undergoing intensive certification and annual recertification to maintain their credentials. During cupping (professional tasting), they assess ten parameters: aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, body, balance, uniformity, clean cup, sweetness, and overall impression. Each parameter is scored separately, and the sum determines the final grade. 80-84 points is 'very good,' 85-89 is 'excellent,' and 90+ is rare, exceptional coffee sought by collectors worldwide.",

        "p_3_point1": "🌱 <strong>High-altitude cultivation.</strong> Specialty coffee grows at 1400-2200 meters elevation, where cold nights slow cherry ripening, concentrating sugars and developing complex flavors. Commercial coffee grows lower, where yields are higher but flavor is flat.",

        "p_3_point4": "🔥 <strong>Fresh roasting in small batches.</strong> Specialty is roasted to order. You receive coffee that's weeks old, not months. Commercial coffee may sit in warehouses for years.",

This isn't exaggeration — it's the actual flavor profile of Ethiopian Yirgacheffe.
