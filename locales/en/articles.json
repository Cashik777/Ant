        "p_intro": "Baristas at cafés have spent years perfecting their technique. They work with expensive equipment and constantly adjust every parameter. But here's the good news: with the right knowledge, you can make espresso that rivals any café.",
        "h3_1": "❌ Mistake 1: Stale Coffee",
        "p_mistake1": "This is mistake #1. Espresso ruthlessly exposes every flaw in your beans. If your coffee is more than 3-4 weeks post-roast, it's already lost most of its aromatic compounds. Counterintuitively, too-fresh coffee (less than 5-7 days) is also problematic — it contains too much CO2 that interferes with extraction.",
        "solution1": "✅ <strong>Solution:</strong> Use coffee 7-21 days after roasting. Check the date on the bag. Buy less, but more frequently.",
        "h3_2": "❌ Mistake 2: Wrong Grind Size",
        "p_mistake2": "Too coarse — water passes through too quickly, under-extraction occurs. Result: watery, sour shot. Too fine — water barely seeps through, over-extraction occurs. Result: bitter, burnt taste. Ideal extraction time for a double shot: 25-30 seconds.",
        "solution2": "✅ <strong>Solution:</strong> Adjust grind step by step. Record extraction time. Target: 25-30 seconds for 36-40g output from 18-20g input.",
        "h3_3": "❌ Mistake 3: Uneven Tamping",
        "p_mistake3": "If you press the tamper at an angle, water finds the path of least resistance and creates 'channels' — spots where it flows faster. Part of the coffee over-extracts (bitter), part under-extracts (sour). Result: inconsistent, unbalanced shot.",
        "solution3": "✅ <strong>Solution:</strong> Keep your elbow at 90°, press evenly with ~15-20kg force. Surface should be perfectly level. Use a WDT tool before tamping.",
        "h3_4": "❌ Mistake 4: Wrong Water Temperature",
        "p_mistake4": "92-96°C is the ideal range. Too hot water (>96°C) burns coffee, producing bitterness and burnt flavors. Too cold (<90°C) under-extracts, creating sour, weak shots. Many home machines don't reach or maintain proper temperature.",
        "solution4": "✅ <strong>Solution:</strong> Warm up machine for at least 15-20 minutes. Run a blank shot before your first pull. Consider a PID controller for more precise control.",
        "h3_5": "❌ Mistake 5: Ignoring Dose and Scales",
        "p_mistake5": "Making espresso 'by eye' is a recipe for inconsistency. Today it's good, tomorrow it's not, and you don't know why. Standard recipe: 18g coffee in → 36g liquid out (1:2 ratio) in 25-30 seconds.",
        "solution5": "✅ <strong>Solution:</strong> Get a scale accurate to 0.1g (they're inexpensive). Weigh coffee in AND liquid out. Record parameters of successful shots.",
        "h3_6": "❌ Mistake 6: Dirty Equipment",
        "p_mistake6": "Coffee oils go rancid over time and accumulate in the portafilter, group head screen, and basket. This old residue adds bitterness and off-flavors to every shot. If your machine hasn't been cleaned recently — you're drinking a mix of fresh coffee and month-old buildup.",
        "solution6": "✅ <strong>Solution:</strong> Wipe portafilter after every shot. Backflush daily (if machine supports it). Deep clean with coffee detergent once a week.",
        "h3_7": "❌ Mistake 7: Bad Water",
        "p_mistake7": "Espresso is 90% water. Hard water with lots of minerals blocks subtle flavors and leaves scale in your boiler. Chlorinated water kills aromas. Too soft (distilled) doesn't extract enough.",
        "solution7": "✅ <strong>Solution:</strong> Use filtered water or bottled with low mineralization. TDS 50-150 ppm is ideal. Avoid unfiltered tap water.",

        "p_3_point1": "🌱 <strong>High-altitude cultivation.</strong> Specialty coffee grows at 1400-2200 meters elevation, where cold nights slow cherry ripening, concentrating sugars and developing complex flavors. Commercial coffee grows lower, where yields are higher but flavor is flat.",
        "p_3_point2": "✋ <strong>Hand-picked at peak ripeness.</strong> Each cherry is harvested by hand at perfect maturity. This means multiple passes through the farm instead of one mechanical harvest. Time and labor cost money.",
        "p_3_point3": "🔬 <strong>Meticulous processing.</strong> Fermentation, drying, sorting — every step is carefully controlled. Defective beans are removed by hand. One defect can ruin an entire cup.",
        "p_3_point4": "🔥 <strong>Fresh roasting in small batches.</strong> Specialty is roasted to order. You receive coffee that's weeks old, not months. Commercial coffee may sit in warehouses for years.",
        "p_3_point5": "💰 <strong>Fair prices for farmers.</strong> Specialty operates on Direct Trade principles — farmers receive 2-3 times more for their coffee than commodity prices. This is an investment in quality and sustainability.",
        "h2_4": "Taste Difference: Specialty vs Commercial",
        "p_4": "Commercial coffee means bitterness, burnt flavors, and one-dimensional taste. It's what we've grown accustomed to, what we consider 'normal coffee.' But Specialty opens an entirely different world. Imagine a cup where you taste notes of blueberry and jasmine, delicate citrus acidity, and a sweet chocolate finish. This isn't exaggeration — it's the actual flavor profile of Ethiopian Yirgacheffe. Specialty coffee can be like wine: complex, layered, with character that depends on region, altitude, processing, and roast. Every lot is unique.",
        "h2_5": "How to Identify Real Specialty Coffee?",
        "p_5": "Unfortunately, the term 'Specialty' isn't legally protected, so it's often misused for marketing. Here's what to look for: roast date (should be within 3-4 weeks), specific country and region of origin (not just 'Arabica'), processing method (washed, natural, honey), stated roast level, and ideally, an SCA score. If the bag only says 'premium arabica' with no details — that's marketing, not Specialty.",
        "h2_6": "Why Should You Try It?",
        "p_6": "Specialty coffee isn't snobbery or a trend. It's respect for the product, for the people who grow it, and for yourself. It's the opportunity to start your morning not with bitter caffeine, but with genuine gastronomic pleasure. Once you try real Specialty coffee, you won't be able to go back to ordinary. Not because you've become picky — but because you've finally discovered what coffee can truly be.",

        "intro": "Among thousands of coffee regions worldwide, one name has become synonymous with perfection. Yirgacheffe isn't just a spot on the Ethiopian map. It's the benchmark for what coffee can be when nature and tradition work in perfect harmony. This is where beans grow that make international cuppers award the highest scores — 90+ points on the SCA scale.",
        "h2_1": "Where is Yirgacheffe?",
        "p_1": "Yirgacheffe is a small town and surrounding coffee region in the Gedeo Zone of southern Ethiopia. While technically part of the larger Sidamo region, its unique terroir earned it a distinct geographical identity. Plantations sit at 1700-2200 meters elevation — the ideal zone for Arabica, where cool nights slow cherry ripening, allowing them to accumulate complex sugars and aromatic compounds.",
        "p_1_2": "The region is surrounded by mountains, covered in tropical forests, and receives ideal rainfall — about 1800mm annually. Soils are rich in minerals from ancient volcanic deposits. This combination of altitude, climate, and soil creates a unique 'terroir' — the taste fingerprint of place.",
        "h2_2": "What Makes Yirgacheffe Special?",
        "p_2": "If you've ever tasted coffee with vibrant floral notes of bergamot, jasmine, or orange blossom — that was Yirgacheffe. Coffee from this region is known for its elegant, tea-like body and bright citrus acidity. This is coffee for those seeking complexity and refinement.",
        "p_2_2": "Ethiopian farmers in Yirgacheffe traditionally use two processing methods. Washed processing yields a clean, bright cup with floral notes. Natural processing — where beans dry inside the cherry — creates a sweeter, fruitier profile with notes of blueberry and strawberry.",

        "h2_4": "How to Brew Yirgacheffe?",
        "p_4": "This delicate coffee shines brightest with filter brewing methods. V60, Chemex, or AeroPress are ideal choices. Avoid espresso or dark roasts — they can overwhelm the subtle floral notes that make Yirgacheffe so prized. Use water at 92-94°C and a medium-fine grind.",
        "p_4_2": "Our recommendation: 15g of coffee to 250ml water, total brew time 2:30-3:00, Result — a crystal-clear cup with garden bouquet aroma and gentle citrus acidity.",
