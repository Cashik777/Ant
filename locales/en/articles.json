        "p_intro": "Baristas at cafés have spent years perfecting their technique. They work with expensive equipment and constantly adjust every parameter. But here's the good news: with the right knowledge, you can make espresso that rivals any café.",
        "h3_1": "❌ Mistake 1: Stale Coffee",
        "p_mistake1": "This is mistake #1. Espresso ruthlessly exposes every flaw in your beans. If your coffee is more than 3-4 weeks post-roast, it's already lost most of its aromatic compounds. Counterintuitively, too-fresh coffee (less than 5-7 days) is also problematic — it contains too much CO2 that interferes with extraction.",
        "solution1": "✅ <strong>Solution:</strong> Use coffee 7-21 days after roasting. Check the date on the bag. Buy less, but more frequently.",
        "h3_2": "❌ Mistake 2: Wrong Grind Size",
        "p_mistake2": "Too coarse — water passes through too quickly, under-extraction occurs. Result: watery, sour shot. Too fine — water barely seeps through, over-extraction occurs. Result: bitter, burnt taste. Ideal extraction time for a double shot: 25-30 seconds.",
        "solution2": "✅ <strong>Solution:</strong> Adjust grind step by step. Record extraction time. Target: 25-30 seconds for 36-40g output from 18-20g input.",
        "h3_3": "❌ Mistake 3: Uneven Tamping",
        "p_mistake3": "If you press the tamper at an angle, water finds the path of least resistance and creates 'channels' — spots where it flows faster. Part of the coffee over-extracts (bitter), part under-extracts (sour). Result: inconsistent, unbalanced shot.",
        "solution3": "✅ <strong>Solution:</strong> Keep your elbow at 90°, press evenly with ~15-20kg force. Surface should be perfectly level. Use a WDT tool before tamping.",
        "h3_4": "❌ Mistake 4: Wrong Water Temperature",
        "p_mistake4": "92-96°C is the ideal range. Too hot water (>96°C) burns coffee, producing bitterness and burnt flavors. Too cold (<90°C) under-extracts, creating sour, weak shots. Many home machines don't reach or maintain proper temperature.",
        "solution4": "✅ <strong>Solution:</strong> Warm up machine for at least 15-20 minutes. Run a blank shot before your first pull. Consider a PID controller for more precise control.",
        "h3_5": "❌ Mistake 5: Ignoring Dose and Scales",
        "p_mistake5": "Making espresso 'by eye' is a recipe for inconsistency. Today it's good, tomorrow it's not, and you don't know why. Standard recipe: 18g coffee in → 36g liquid out (1:2 ratio) in 25-30 seconds.",
        "solution5": "✅ <strong>Solution:</strong> Get a scale accurate to 0.1g (they're inexpensive). Weigh coffee in AND liquid out. Record parameters of successful shots.",
        "h3_6": "❌ Mistake 6: Dirty Equipment",
        "p_mistake6": "Coffee oils go rancid over time and accumulate in the portafilter, group head screen, and basket. This old residue adds bitterness and off-flavors to every shot. If your machine hasn't been cleaned recently — you're drinking a mix of fresh coffee and month-old buildup.",
        "solution6": "✅ <strong>Solution:</strong> Wipe portafilter after every shot. Backflush daily (if machine supports it). Deep clean with coffee detergent once a week.",
        "h3_7": "❌ Mistake 7: Bad Water",
        "p_mistake7": "Espresso is 90% water. Hard water with lots of minerals blocks subtle flavors and leaves scale in your boiler. Chlorinated water kills aromas. Too soft (distilled) doesn't extract enough.",
        "solution7": "✅ <strong>Solution:</strong> Use filtered water or bottled with low mineralization. TDS 50-150 ppm is ideal. Avoid unfiltered tap water.",

        "p_light_intro": "Beans are roasted to the first 'crack' — when they pop from accumulated CO2. Temperature: ~180-205°C. Color: light brown, no oil on surface.",
        "p_light_flavor": "Flavor: Bright, vibrant acidity (not sour, but pleasant freshness like good wine). Floral, fruity, tea-like notes. This is the 'true' taste of the bean — terroir, processing, everything is readable.",

Ethiopia isn't just another coffee-producing country. It's a sanctuary where over 6,000 unique varieties of Arabica grow, many without even names. It's a place where coffee isn't just a beverage — it's part of the nation's soul.",
        "h2_1": "The Legend of Kaldi the Goatherd",
        "p_1": "In the 9th century, in the region of Kaffa (from which the very word 'coffee' derives), lived a young goatherd named Kaldi. One day he noticed something strange: his goats, usually calm and slow, suddenly began dancing and jumping with incredible energy. Kaldi followed them and saw they were eating bright red berries from a small bush. Curious, the shepherd tried the berries himself — and felt an unusual surge of energy and mental clarity.",
        "p_1_2": "Kaldi shared his discovery with monks at a nearby monastery. At first they were skeptical, even throwing the berries into the fire as 'devil's fruit.' But when the air filled with the incredible aroma of roasting beans, they changed their minds. The monks began brewing the beans and drinking the beverage to stay alert during nighttime prayers. Thus, the tradition of coffee was born.",
        "h2_2": "Why is Ethiopia Special?",
        "p_2": "Ethiopia is the only country in the world where coffee grows wild in nature. Thousands of years of evolution in mountains at 1500-2200 meters elevation created incredible genetic diversity. Each valley, each mountain slope has its own unique varieties with distinct flavor profiles. It's like the vineyards of Burgundy, but for coffee.",
        "p_2_2": "Unlike other countries that cultivate 2-3 commercial varieties, Ethiopian farmers often don't know exactly which varieties grow on their plots — they simply call them 'heirloom.' This genetic diversity is why Ethiopian coffee is so vibrant and unrepeatable.",

        "intro": "Have you ever wondered why one bag of coffee costs $5 and another costs $25? Why espresso at one café tastes bitter and bland, while at another it's an explosion of flavors? The answer lies in one word: Specialty. And no, it's not a marketing gimmick — it's a rigorous grading system that separates ordinary coffee from true culinary artistry.",
        "h2_1": "What Does 'Specialty Coffee' Mean?",
        "p_1": "Specialty Coffee is not a brand or a variety. It's an official term introduced by the Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) to designate coffee of the highest quality. To earn this status, coffee must score 80 points or higher on a 100-point scale during professional cupping. Less than 3% of the world's coffee achieves this level. Think about it: out of every 100 kilograms of harvested beans, only 3 kilograms can be called Specialty. The rest ends up on supermarket shelves labeled as 'premium' or '100% Arabica' — words that actually guarantee nothing about quality.",
        "h2_2": "How is Specialty Coffee Graded?",
        "p_2": "Professional tasters called Q-graders evaluate coffee using strict SCA protocols. They're the 'sommeliers of the coffee world' — undergoing intensive certification and annual recertification to maintain their credentials. During cupping (professional tasting), they assess ten parameters: aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, body, balance, uniformity, clean cup, sweetness, and overall impression. Each parameter is scored separately, and the sum determines the final grade. 80-84 points is 'very good,' 85-89 is 'excellent,' and 90+ is rare, exceptional coffee sought by collectors worldwide.",

        "p_3_point1": "🌱 <strong>High-altitude cultivation.</strong> Specialty coffee grows at 1400-2200 meters elevation, where cold nights slow cherry ripening, concentrating sugars and developing complex flavors. Commercial coffee grows lower, where yields are higher but flavor is flat.",
        "p_3_point2": "✋ <strong>Hand-picked at peak ripeness.</strong> Each cherry is harvested by hand at perfect maturity. This means multiple passes through the farm instead of one mechanical harvest. Time and labor cost money.",
        "p_3_point3": "🔬 <strong>Meticulous processing.</strong> Fermentation, drying, sorting — every step is carefully controlled. Defective beans are removed by hand. One defect can ruin an entire cup.",
        "p_3_point4": "🔥 <strong>Fresh roasting in small batches.</strong> Specialty is roasted to order. You receive coffee that's weeks old, not months. Commercial coffee may sit in warehouses for years.",
        "p_3_point5": "💰 <strong>Fair prices for farmers.</strong> Specialty operates on Direct Trade principles — farmers receive 2-3 times more for their coffee than commodity prices. This is an investment in quality and sustainability.",
        "h2_4": "Taste Difference: Specialty vs Commercial",
        "p_4": "Commercial coffee means bitterness, burnt flavors, and one-dimensional taste. It's what we've grown accustomed to, what we consider 'normal coffee.' But Specialty opens an entirely different world. Imagine a cup where you taste notes of blueberry and jasmine, delicate citrus acidity, and a sweet chocolate finish. This isn't exaggeration — it's the actual flavor profile of Ethiopian Yirgacheffe. Specialty coffee can be like wine: complex, layered, with character that depends on region, altitude, processing, and roast. Every lot is unique.",
        "h2_5": "How to Identify Real Specialty Coffee?",
        "p_5": "Unfortunately, the term 'Specialty' isn't legally protected, so it's often misused for marketing. Here's what to look for: roast date (should be within 3-4 weeks), specific country and region of origin (not just 'Arabica'), processing method (washed, natural, honey), stated roast level, and ideally, an SCA score. If the bag only says 'premium arabica' with no details — that's marketing, not Specialty.",
        "h2_6": "Why Should You Try It?",
        "p_6": "Specialty coffee isn't snobbery or a trend. It's respect for the product, for the people who grow it, and for yourself. It's the opportunity to start your morning not with bitter caffeine, but with genuine gastronomic pleasure. Once you try real Specialty coffee, you won't be able to go back to ordinary. Not because you've become picky — but because you've finally discovered what coffee can truly be.",
