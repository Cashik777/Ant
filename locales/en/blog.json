            "h3_1": "Mistake #1: Stale Coffee",
            "mistake1_problem": "**Problem**: Using coffee roasted months ago or bought from supermarket without roast date.",
            "mistake1_why": "**Why it's bad**: Espresso ruthlessly reveals coffee's age. Old beans lose CO2 needed for creamy crema and develop rancid flavors.",
            "mistake1_fix": "**Solution**: Use coffee 7-21 days after roasting. Too fresh (under 5 days) — too much gas, unstable extraction. Older than 4 weeks — loss of flavor and crema.",
            "mistake1_tip": "**Tip**: Buying by the kilogram? Portion and vacuum-freeze — this preserves freshness for months.",
            "h3_2": "Mistake #2: Wrong Grind Size",

            "mistake3_problem": "**Problem**: Uneven pressure or angled tamp, insufficient or excessive pressure.",
            "mistake3_why": "**Why it's bad**: Water takes path of least resistance. Uneven bed = channeling, where some coffee is over-extracted, some under-extracted.",

            "mistake5_fix": "**Solution**: Use scales! Standard double shot: 18-20g ground coffee in → 36-40g beverage out (1:2 ratio).",

            "intro_2": "Sidamo is a region of contrasts: from misty highlands with delicate floral notes to warm valleys with intense fruity flavors. Here, coffee is born that can surprise even experienced connoisseurs.",

            "geography_1": "The Sidamo region is located in southern Ethiopia, in the large administrative region of SNNPR (Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region). It's one of the country's largest coffee-producing zones.",
            "geography_2": "Coffee plantations are spread across elevations from 1,400 to 2,200 meters above sea level. This diversity of altitudes creates a mosaic of microclimates, each affecting the coffee's flavor characteristics.",
            "geography_3": "The region's climate is humid subtropical with distinct seasons: rainy season (June–September) and dry season (October–May). Average annual rainfall is 1,200-1,800 mm.",
            "geography_4": "Temperature is stable throughout the year: 15-25°C during the day, 10-15°C at night. These cool nights slow berry ripening and allow beans to accumulate complex sugars and organic acids.",
            "geography_5": "Soils are predominantly volcanic — red laterites rich in iron and organic matter. They provide ideal drainage and rich mineral nutrition for coffee trees.",
            "h2_2": "Sidamo Sub-regions",

            "processing_natural": "**Natural processing**: Traditional method for remote farms. Whole cherries dry in the sun for 3-4 weeks. Result: intense fruity taste, wine notes, rich sweetness. Popular among specialty roasters.",
            "processing_honey": "**Honey processing**: Relatively new for the region, gaining popularity. Some mucilage remains on the bean during drying. Result: balance between washed clarity and natural sweetness.",

            "intro_1": "You've probably noticed: in one café, an americano costs $2, in another — $6. The difference isn't just in the interior or location. Often it's the difference between commercial and specialty coffee — two different universes in one cup.",
            "intro_2": "Specialty coffee is not a marketing term or hipster fad. It's a clearly defined category with objective quality criteria that guarantees a certain level of taste. Today we'll break down what that actually means.",

            "sca_scale": "Coffee is graded on a 100-point scale by certified Q-graders — professionals who have undergone rigorous training and testing. The evaluation is based on cupping — a standardized tasting procedure.",

            "diff_roasting": "**Roasting**: Specialty is roasted in small batches with freshness of 7-30 days. Commercial is mass-roasted and often sits on shelves for months.",
